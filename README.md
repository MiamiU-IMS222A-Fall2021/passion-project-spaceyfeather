## Expectations and Grading
The grading of this project will not only be on the code working, but on excellence of design and implementation as well. 

Each category is worth 15 points. In each of these categories the first 10 points will be on fulfilling the stated minimum. If the code works, you get the points. The remaining five points for each section will be graded on the excellence of implementation. Thus 30 points just for getting it working and 20 points based on excellence within the various categories.

Use this as a checklist for your final project.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Experimenting with Javascript: If you use advanced Javascript/CSS or storytelling tools on your project pages, I will count that as two pages of content. Check with me if you have any questions about what qualifies!
