        <p>You'll see that I rarely think things through. After all, the project is only titled <em>Welcome to
                Vriodel</em> because I haven't yet come up with a better name. The realm name alone feels empty, so
            we're stuck with an accidental homage to <em>Welcome to Night Vale</em> instead.
            <br>
            <br>This page is primarily slideshows of art/design progression over time.

                    <p>Ada, unlike most of my known characters, did not start as a fan character, but like most, her
                        design was spontaneous. Her first reference was made as one of the first pieces on my macbook,
                        to test out using Medibang on a laptop that did not crash after five minutes. It was a bit odd
                        and complicated (though admittedly it's moreso now). Most of my early art of her is just a
                        nearly plain-grey wolf used for vent art, and it wasn't until later that she actually got some
                        color and importance.
                        <br>I can't remember where the name Ada comes from (though she does admittedly
                        look like Ada from Petz Catz 2 for the Wii), but Traube was chosen as it's german for grape. Why
                        is this important, why should anyone care? Well, the only fun fact about my family history that
                        I can ever remember is that our ancestors smuggled grapes into America by sewing the vines into
                        their jackets. We have descendants of those vines in our back yard.
                        <br>Her design has never been consistent, and might not ever be. Her stripes and patterns change
                        constantly, and half the time the reason she has three stripes on her face in one sketch and
                        four in the next is because I ran out of space.
                        <br>Ironically, while being the most integral part of WtV, Adaeth has been around a relatively
                        short time.
