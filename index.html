                <h2>What is this?</h2>
                <p>WtV is a fantasy story that's been in the works for... 4 years? Possibly? The earliest music dates
                    back to 2015, characters to 2016, writings around 2017. There is, in fact, a LOT of writing, but I
                    am tired and they are old and this project is taking more time than I thought (it's okay though this
                    is the most enjoyable one).
                    <br>The story primarily focuses on loss, changes, and grief. Primarily, it served as a coping
                    mechanism, and I hope to be able to turn it into a reflection on mental health.

                <h2>Where is this going?</h2>
                <p>We have no idea!
                    <br>It's been a number of ideas over time. A webcomic, written work, 3D game (more open-world), who
                    knows anymore. Hopefully I can get a better idea as I continue with college and expand my creative
                    abilities.
                    <br>There have been two (failed) discord servers with the intent to share and continue work on it.
                    (Entirely my fault, as I've had zero social outlet or following of not-friends anywhere for a while
                    now.) In fact, save for my professor, you're likely one of those people! I am so sorry that 2016 me
                    existed. /lh
