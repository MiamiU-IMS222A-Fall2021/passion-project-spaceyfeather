        <h1>The Realm</h1>
        <p>Vriodel is a vast expanse of forests and mountains home primarily to woodland fauna and the occasional
            mythical creature. It is often cloudy, obscuring the sun and keeping the level of light constant throughout
            the day. The night sky is always full of life, and the stars shine clearly no matter how bright and full the
            moon may be.</p>

        <img src="images/etc/wtv_inkarnatemap.jpg"
            alt="a map of a fantasy world, primarily made of forests. the west, at the top of the map, has an ocean with a dragon-shaped island named Farrich. to the south is a barren moor named Waleryn. to the north is a dense pine forest on a cliff named Locke. it houses a facility. in the center of the map is a mountain range, with the centermost peaks labeled as the dawn and dusk peaks. a village named Raines sits between it and a forest named Evairn to the southwest. further east is a ruined castle named Laybourn. north from there is a barren forest named ni'rr, surrounded by a thick circle of pine trees. finally, north of that lies a larger village named Tarri."

                    <p>Two towering mountains in the center of the realm, shaped almost like a pair of crows. A thin
                        stone bridge connects them.
                        The surrounding mountains have been reduced to rubble, but many creatures still call them home.
                        Dusk Peak is riddled with small caves, and it is rumored that Adaeth resides in one of them.</p>

                        Vriodel after the destruction of the castle. A harsh wind blows down from Dusk Peak , often
